# Free-RTOS-Traffic-Light-System

Completed in Spring 2020.

Designed and implemented a traffic light simulation on an STM32F4 Discovery board using an implementation of FreeRTOS. Learning outcomes focused on using hardware components, middleware, and FreeRTOS features such as tasks, queues, and software timers.

The traffic light system simulates vehicle traffic on a one-way, one-lane road with a simplified intersection that has a single traffic light. The system contains three main components:

1. The traffic flow adjustment potentiometer to dynamically adjust the traffic flow rate
2. The LEDs representing cars
3. The single traffic light
